            The mantle of evening is veiling the sky,<br /> And over the
            landscape its soft shadows lie;<br /> The old year is passing, a new
            year will reign,<br /> Ere earth shall awaken to day-dawn again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dear Grandma has folded her knitting away,<br /> And muses alone at
            the close of the day;<br /> While the old clock ticks solemnly off,
            one by one,<br /> The moments yet left to the year almost done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out from the shadows fast filling the room,<br /> Out from the dying
            year's gathering gloom,<br /> Many sweet pictures of past happy years<br />
            Come flitting again with their hopes and their fears.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the broad hearthstone the dull embers glow,<br /> The old year's
            last hours are quiet and slow;<br /> But back to the Past, with its
            pleasures and pain&mdash;<br /> Of the Present unmindful, she wanders
            again.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is seeing dear faces, and clasping the hand<br /> Of many a
            friend in the shadowy land,<br /> And the ghosts of old years she has
            watched in and out,<br /> Come forth from the shadows and hedge her
            about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hark! What is that stealing thro' silence and gloom,<br /> To fill
            with sweet melody Grandma's lone room?<br /> What brings that fond
            smile, and dispels every trace<br /> Of sadness and tears on the
            dear, aged face?

            And adding sweet words that our baby loves more.

            So sings this mother to baby to-night,<br /> While nearer and nearer

            long<br /> Lies slumbering, and hushed is the lullaby song.

            While mother takes up a new duty, and so<br /> From one to another

            The strains of the lullaby bear her away<br /> O'er the lapse of long

            babyhood's skies<br /> Where sunshine is dancing before her blue

            with a clang to the world and its people;<br /> And merrily sounding
            afar and anear,<br /> Proclaim the glad tidings, "The New Year is
            here!"
          </p>
          <p>
            And from other steeples the noise is resounding,<br /> As jubilant
            bells the same story are sounding;<br /> And so 'mid the clanging,
            the poor old year dies,<br /> And the new youthful year opens
            wondering eyes
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>And so does the baby</i>! So frightened is he,<br /> His shrill
            cry rings out with the bells' jubilee,<br /> And quick to his side
            the young mother has sped,<br /> To bend o'er her baby's her own
            golden head
          </p>
          <p>
            While Grandpa and Grandma are listening to hear,<br /> 'Mid the
            clanging of bells, the young voice sweet and clear,<br /> Which
            tenderly lays on the New Year the song<br /> Of the dear "Old-time
            lullaby" cherished so long
          </p>
          <p>
            So softly it floats thro' the shadowy gloom<br /> Which tenderly
            broods o'er the old fashioned room,<br /> Where Grandma and Grandpa,
            while steeple bells ring,<br /> Again lift their tremulous voices and
            sing&mdash;

            Hush, my dear! Lie still, and slumber!<br /> Holy angels guard thy
            bed!<br /> Heavenly blessings, without number,<br /> Gently falling on
            thy head.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sleep, my babe! Thy food and raiment,<br /> House and home, thy
            friends provide;<br /> All without thy care or payment,<br /> All thy
            wants are well supplied.
          </p>
          <p>
            How much better thou'rt attended<br /> Than the Son of God could be,<br />
            When from heaven He descended,<br /> And became a child like thee!
          </p>
          <p>
            Soft and easy is thy cradle:<br /> Coarse and hard thy Saviour lay,<br />
            When His birth-place was a stable,<br /> And His softest bed was hay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blessed Babe! What glorious features,&mdash;<br /> Spotless fair,
            divinely bright!<br /> Must he dwell with brutal creatures?<br /> How
            could angels bear the sight?
          </p>
          <p>
            Was there nothing but a manger,<br /> Cursed sinners could afford,<br />
            To receive the Heavenly Stranger?<br /> Did they thus affront the
            Lord?
          </p>
          <p>
            Soft, my child! I did not chide thee,<br /> Though my song might
            sound too hard;<br /> 'Tis thy mother sits beside thee,<br /> And her
            arm shall be thy guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet to read the shameful story,<br /> How the Jews abused their King;<br />
            How they served the Lord of Glory,<br /> Makes me angry while I sing.
          </p>
          <p>
            See the kinder shepherds round Him,<br /> Telling wonders from the
            sky!<br /> Where they sought Him, there they found Him,<br /> With His
            Virgin-Mother by.
          </p>
          <p>
            See the lovely Babe a-dressing:<br /> Lovely Infant, how He smiled!<br />
            When He wept, His Mother's blessing<br /> Sooth'd and hush'd the Holy
            Child.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lo, He slumbers in a manger,<br /> Where the horned oxen fed!<br />
            Peace, my darling, here's no danger;<br /> There's no ox a-near thy

            May'st thou live to know and fear Him,<br /> Trust and love Him all

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
